(** Constant_info represents a constant. A constant has a type associated

    can be obtained by calling GIConstant.get_value. *)

val get_type : t structure ptr -> Type_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type of the constant as a Type_info. *)

val cast_from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes base info to constant info. *)

val cast_to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes constant info to base info *)

val add_unref_finaliser : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Add unref of the C underlying structure with Gc.finalise. *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Constant_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Base_info.t form a Constant_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val get_value : t structure ptr -> Types.argument_t union ptr
(** Obtain the value associated with the Constant_info and store it in the
    value parameter. argument needs to be allocated before passing it in. The
    size of the constant value stored in argument will be returned. Free the
    value with Constant_info.free_value. *)
