open Ctypes

type t
(** A Enum_info represents an enumeration and a Value_info struct represents
    a value of an enumeration. The Enum_info contains a set of values and a
    type The Value_info is fetched by calling Enum_info.get_value on a
    Enum_info.*)

val enuminfo : t structure typ

val get_n_values : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the number of values this enumeration contains. *)

val get_n_methods : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the number of methods that this enum type has. *)

val get_method : t structure ptr -> int -> Function_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain an enum type method at index n . *)

val get_value : t structure ptr -> int -> Value_info.t structure ptr option
(** Obtain a value for this enumeration. *)

val get_error_domain : t structure ptr -> string option
(** Obtain the string form of the quark for the error domain associated with
    this enum, if any. *)

val get_storage_type : t structure ptr -> Bindings.Types.tag
(** Obtain the tag of the type used for the enum in the C ABI. This will
    be a signed or unsigned integral type.
    Note that in the current implementation the width of the type is computed
    correctly, but the signed or unsigned nature of the type may not match the
    sign of the type used by the C compiler. *)

val cast_from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes base info to enum info. *)

(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes enum info to base info *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Enum_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with

(** Return a Enum_info.t from a Registered_type_info.t, the underlying C structure
