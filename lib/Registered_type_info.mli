(**  Registered_type_info â€” Struct representing a struct with a GType. *)

open Ctypes

(** Registered_type_info represents an entity with a GType associated. Could be
    either a Enum_info, Interface_info, Object_info, Struct_info or a
    Union_info.
    A registered type info struct has a name and a type function. To get the
    name call Registered_type_info.get_type_name. Most users want to call
    Registered_type_info.get_g_type and don't worry about the rest of the
    details. *)

type t

val registeredtypeinfo : t structure typ

val get_type_name : t structure ptr -> string option
(** Obtain the type name of the struct within the GObject type system.
    This type can be passed to g_type_name() to get a #GType. *)

val get_g_type : t structure ptr -> Repository.gtype option
(** Obtain the gtype for this registered type or None which a special meaning.
    It means that either there is no type information associated with this info or
    that the shared library which provides the type_init function for this
    info cannot be called. *)

val get_type_init : t structure ptr -> string option
(** Obtain the type init function for info . The type init function is the
    function which will register the GType within the GObject type system.
    Usually this is not called by language bindings or applications, use
    Registered_type_info.get_g_type directly instead. *)

val cast_from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes base info to registeredtype info. *)

val cast_to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes registeredtype info to base info *)

val add_unref_finaliser : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Add unref of the C underlying structure with Gc.finalise. *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Registered_type_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Base_info.t from a Registered_type_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)
