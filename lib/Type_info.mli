type t
(** Type_info represents a type. You can retrieve a type info from an argument
    (see Arg_info), a function return value (see Function_info), a field
    (see Field_info), a property (see Property_info), a constant
    (see Constant_info) or for a union discriminator (see Union_info).
    A type can either be a of a basic type which is a standard C primitive type
    or an interface type. For interface types you need to call
    Type_info.get_interface to get a reference to the base info for that
    interface. *)

val typeinfo : t structure typ

val to_string : t structure ptr -> string
(** Obtain a string representation of type. *)

val is_pointer : t structure ptr -> bool
(** Obtain if the type is passed as a reference.
    Note that the types of GI_DIRECTION_OUT and GI_DIRECTION_INOUT parameters
    will only be pointers if the underlying type being transferred is a pointer
    (i.e. only if the type of the C function’s formal parameter is a pointer to
    a pointer). *)

val get_tag : t structure ptr -> Bindings.Types.tag
(** Obtain the type tag for the type. See GITypeTag for a list of type tags. *)

val get_array_length : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the array length of the type. The type tag must be a GIType.array or
    -1 will returned. *)

val get_array_fixed_size : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the fixed array size of the type. The type tag must be a
    GIType.array or -1 will returned. *)

val is_zero_terminated : t structure ptr -> bool
(** Obtain if the last element of the array is NULL. The type tag must be a
    GIType.array  or FALSE will returned. *)

val get_array_type : t structure ptr -> Bindings.Types.array_type option
(** Obtain the array type for this type. See GIArrayType for a list of possible
    values. If the type tag of this type is not array, None will be returned. *)

val unsafe_get_param_type : t structure ptr -> int -> t structure ptr
(** Obtain the parameter type n. It is used to get the parameter type of generic
 *  container. For example if the current Type_info.t is an array, a GList, a
 *  GSList or an Hash, you have to use this in order to get the Type_info.t of
 *  the data of the container.
 *  Basically it is done with Type_info.get_param_type type_info 0 .

 *  This function is unsafe meanings that it is your responsibility to not use
 *  a number out of bounds.
 *)

val get_param_type : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** This is just an alias to Type_info.unsage_get_param_type with the index set
    to 0.
*)

val get_interface : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr option
(** For types which have Types.Interface such as GObjects and boxed
    values, this function returns full information about the referenced type.
    You can then inspect the type of the returned Base_info to further query
    whether it is a concrete GObject, a GInterface, a structure, etc. using
    Base_info.get_type. *)

val cast_from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes base info to typeinfo. *)

val cast_to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes typeinfo to base info *)

val add_unref_finaliser : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Add unref of the C underlying structure with Gc.finalise. *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Type_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Base_info.t form a Type_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)
