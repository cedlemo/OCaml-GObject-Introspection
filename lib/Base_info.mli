val base_info_ref : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Increases the reference count of underlying Base_info *info. *)

val base_info_unref : t structure ptr -> unit
(** Decreases the reference count of underlying Base_info *info . When its
    reference count drops to 0, the info is freed. *)

val get_name : t structure ptr -> string option
(** Obtain the name of the info . What the name represents depends on the
    GIInfoType of the info . For instance for Function_info it is the name of
    the function.*)

val equal : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr -> bool
(** Compare two Base_info.
    Using pointer comparison is not practical since many functions return
    different instances of Base_info that refers to the same part of the
    TypeLib; use this function instead to do Base_info comparisons. *)

val get_namespace : t structure ptr -> string
(** Obtain the namespace of info *)

val is_deprecated : t structure ptr -> bool
(** Obtain whether the info is represents a metadata which is deprecated or not. *)

val get_container : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr option
(** Obtain the container of the info . The container is the parent Base_info.
    For instance, the parent of a Function_info is an Object_info or
    Interface_info. *)

val get_type : t structure ptr -> Bindings.Base_info.info_type
