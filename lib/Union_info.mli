(** Union_info represents a union type.
    A union has methods and fields. Unions can optionally have a discriminator,
    which is a field deciding what type of real union fields is valid for
    specified instance.*)

val unioninfo : t structure typ

val get_n_fields : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the number of fields this union has. *)

val get_size : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the total size of the union. *)

val get_alignment : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the required alignment of the union. *)

val get_n_methods : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the number of methods this union has. *)

val get_field : t structure ptr -> int -> Field_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type information for field with specified index. *)

val get_method : t structure ptr -> int -> Function_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type information for method with specified index. *)

val find_method :
  t structure ptr -> string -> Function_info.t structure ptr option
(** Obtain the type information for method named name .*)

val is_discriminated : t structure ptr -> bool
(** Return true if this union contains discriminator field. *)

val get_discriminator_offset : t structure ptr -> int
(** Returns offset of the discriminator field in the structure. *)

val get_discriminator_type : t structure ptr -> Type_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type information of the union discriminator. *)

val get_discriminator : t structure ptr -> int -> Constant_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain discriminator value assigned for n-th union field, i.e. n-th union
    field is the active one if discriminator contains this constant. *)

val cast_from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes base info to union info. *)

val cast_to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes union info to base info *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Union_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Base_info.t form a Union_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val cast_from_registeredtypeinfo :
  Registered_type_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes registeredtype info to union info. *)

val cast_to_registeredtypeinfo :
  t structure ptr -> Registered_type_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes union info to registeredtype info *)

val from_registeredtypeinfo :
  Registered_type_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Union_info.t from a Registered_type_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Registered_type_info.registeredtypeinfo_unref. *)

val to_registeredtypeinfo :
  t structure ptr -> Registered_type_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Registered_type_info.t form a Union_info, the underlying C structure
