(** Function_info represents a function, method or constructor. To find out
    what kind of entity a Function_info represents, call
    Function_info.get_flags.
    See also Callable_info for information on how to retrieve arguments and
    other metadata. *)

val get_symbol : t structure ptr -> string
(** Obtain the symbol of the function. The symbol is the name of the exported
    function, suitable to be used as an argument to g_module_symbol().*)

val get_flags : t structure ptr -> Bindings.Function_info.flags list
(** Obtain the Function_infoFlags for the info . *)

val get_property : t structure ptr -> Property_info.t structure ptr option
(** Obtain the property associated with this Function_info. Only
    Function_info with the flag GIFunction.Is_getter or GIFunction.Is_setter
    have a property set. For other cases, NULL will be returned. *)

val get_vfunc : t structure ptr -> Callable_info.t structure ptr option
(** Obtain the virtual function associated with this Function_info. Only
    Function_info with the flag Wraps_vfunc has a virtual function set. For
    other cases, None will be returned.
    In order to avoid circular call graph between Function_info and VFunc_info,
    this function will return a Callable_info. It is up to the user to use
    VFunc_info.from_callableinfo in order to have the VFunc_info.*)
