type t
(** Signal_info represents a signal. It's a sub-struct of Callable_info and
    contains a set of flags and a class closure.
    See Callable_info for information on how to retrieve arguments and other
    metadata from the signal. *)

val signalinfo : t structure typ

val true_stops_emit : t structure ptr -> bool
(** Obtain if the returning true in the signal handler will stop the emission
    of the signal. *)

val get_flags : t structure ptr -> Bindings.GSignal.flags list
(** Obtain the flags for this signal info. See GSignalFlags for more
    information about possible flag values. *)

val get_class_closure : t structure ptr -> Callable_info.t structure ptr option
(** Obtain the class closure for this signal if one is set. The class closure
    is a virtual function on the type that the signal belongs to. If the signal
    lacks a closure None will be returned.
    In order to avoid circular call graph between Signal_info and VFunc_info,
    this function will return a Callable_info. It is up to the user to use
    GIVSignalInfo.from_callableinfo in order to have the VFunc_info.*)

val cast_from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes base info to signal info. *)

val cast_to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes signal info to base info *)

val add_unref_finaliser : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Add unref of the C underlying structure with Gc.finalise. *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Signal_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Base_info.t from a Signal_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val cast_from_callableinfo : Callable_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes callable info to signal info. *)

val cast_to_callableinfo : t structure ptr -> Callable_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes signal info to callable info *)

val from_callableinfo : Callable_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Signal_info.t from a Callable_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_callableinfo : t structure ptr -> Callable_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Callable_info.t from a Signal_info, the underlying C structure
