(** Struct_info â€” Module representing a C structure *)

open Ctypes

type t
(** Struct_info represents a generic C structure type.
 A structure has methods and fields.*)

val structinfo : t structure typ

val is_gtype_struct : t structure ptr -> bool
(** Return true if this structure represents the "class structure" for some
    GObject or GInterface. This function is mainly useful to hide this kind of
    structure from generated public APIs.
*)

val get_alignment : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the required alignment of the structure.*)

val get_size : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the total size of the structure. *)

val is_foreign : t structure ptr -> bool
(** No doc yet *)

val get_n_fields : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the number of fields this structure has. *)

val get_n_methods : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the number of methods this structure has. *)

val get_field : t structure ptr -> int -> Field_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type information for field with specified index. *)

val get_method : t structure ptr -> int -> Function_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type information for method with specified index. *)

val find_method :
  t structure ptr -> string -> Function_info.t structure ptr option
(** Obtain the type information for method named name .*)

val add_unref_finaliser : t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Add unref of the C underlying structure with Gc.finalise. *)

val from_baseinfo : Base_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Struct_info.t from a Base_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

val to_baseinfo : t structure ptr -> Base_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Base_info.t form a Struct_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Base_info.baseinfo_unref. *)

  Registered_type_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes registeredtype info to struct info. *)

  t structure ptr -> Registered_type_info.t structure ptr
(** Just cast OCaml Ctypes struct info to registeredtype info *)

val from_registeredtypeinfo :
  Registered_type_info.t structure ptr -> t structure ptr
(** Return a Struct_info.t from a Registered_type_info.t, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
    Registered_type_info.registeredtypeinfo_unref. *)

val to_registeredtypeinfo :
  t structure ptr -> Registered_type_info.t structure ptr
(** Return a Registered_type_info.t form a Struct_info, the underlying C structure
    ref count is increased and the value is Gc.finalis"ed" with
