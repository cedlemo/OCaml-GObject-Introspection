(** A Field_info struct represents a field of a struct (see Struct_info),
    union (see Union_info) or an object (see Object_info).
    The Field_info is fetched by calling
    Struct_info.get_field,
    Union_info.get_field
    or Object_info.get_field. A field has a size, type and a struct offset
    associated and a set of flags, which is currently
    GI_FIELD_IS_READABLE or GI_FIELD_IS_WRITABLE.*)

val fieldinfo : t structure typ

val get_flags : t structure ptr -> Bindings.Field_info.flags list
(** Obtain the flags for this Field_info. See Field_info.flags for possible
    flag values. *)

val get_offset : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the offset in bits of the field member, this is relative to the
    beginning of the struct or union. *)

val get_size : t structure ptr -> int
(** Obtain the size in bits of the field member, this is how much space you
    need to allocate to store the field. *)

val get_type : t structure ptr -> Type_info.t structure ptr
(** Obtain the type of a field as a Type_info. *)
