(** The transfer is the exchange of data between two parts, from the callee to
    the caller. The callee is either a function/method/signal or an
    object/interface where a property is defined. The caller is the side
    accessing a property or calling a function. GITransfer specifies who's
    responsible for freeing the resources after the ownership transfer is
    complete. In case of a containing type such as a list, an array or a hash
    table the container itself is specified differently from the items within
    the container itself. Each container is freed differently, check the
    documentation for the types themselves for information on how to free them. *)

          the property belongs to) to the caller. The callee retains the
          ownership of the transfer and the caller doesn't need to do
          anything to free up the resources of this transfer. *)
  | Container
      (** transfer the container (list, array, hash table) from the callee
          to the caller. The callee retains the ownership of the individual
          items in the container and the caller has to free up the
          container resources (g_list_free()/ g_hash_table_destroy() etc)
          of this transfer. *)
  | Everything
      (** transfer everything, eg the container and its contents from the
          callee to the caller. This is the case when the callee creates a
          copy of all the data it returns. The caller is responsible for
          cleaning up the container and item resources of this transfer. *)
