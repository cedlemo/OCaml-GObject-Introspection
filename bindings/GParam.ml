(* Flags defined in the GObject library for the GParamSpec module. I deliberatly

 * Through the GParamFlags flag values, certain aspects of parameters can be
 * configured. *)
type flags =
  | Readable  (** the parameter is readable *)
  | Writable  (** the parameter is writable *)
  | Readwrite  (** alias for G_PARAM_READABLE | G_PARAM_WRITABLE *)
  | Construct  (** the parameter will be set upon object construction *)
  | Construct_only
      (** the parameter can only be set upon object construction *)
  | Lax_validation
      (** upon parameter conversion (see g_param_value_convert()) strict
          validation is not required *)
  | Static_name
      (** the string used as name when constructing the parameter is
          guaranteed to remain valid and unmodified for the lifetime of the
          parameter. Since 2.8 *)
  | Static_nick
      (** the string used as nick when constructing the parameter is
          guaranteed to remain valid and unmmodified for the lifetime of
          the parameter. Since 2.8 *)
  | Static_blurb
      (** the string used as blurb when constructing the parameter is
          guaranteed to remain valid and unmodified for the lifetime of the
          parameter. Since 2.8 *)
  | Explicit_notify
      (** calls to g_object_set_property() for this property will not
          automatically result in a "notify" signal being emitted: the
          implementation must call g_object_notify() themselves in case the
          property actually changes.  Since: 2.42. *)
  | Deprecated
      (** the parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future
          version. A warning will be generated if it is used while running
          with G_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC=1.  Since 2.26 *)
